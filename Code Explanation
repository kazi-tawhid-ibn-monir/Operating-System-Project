line-by-line explanation of the key sections of each script used in your project. For each script, I'll highlight important functionality, followed by a line-by-line breakdown. 
1. Process Management Script (process_management.sh)

Code Example:   

#!/bin/bash
echo "Current Running Processes:"
ps aux
read -p "Enter PID to kill: " pid
kill $pid 

Explanation:

    #!/bin/bash: This line defines the script's interpreter, indicating that it should be run using the Bash shell.
    echo "Current Running Processes:": Prints a message to the terminal, indicating that the next output will list running processes.
    ps aux: Executes the ps command with options a, u, and x to display information about all running processes.
        a: Show processes for all users.
        u: Show user-oriented format (includes username).
        x: Include processes without a controlling terminal.
    read -p "Enter PID to kill: " pid: Prompts the user to enter a Process ID (PID). The entered PID is stored in the variable pid.
    kill $pid: This command attempts to terminate the process with the specified PID. If the PID is valid, the corresponding process will be killed.




2. Disk Monitoring Script (disk_monitoring.sh)
Code Example:   

#!/bin/bash
df -h | awk '$5 > 80 {print "Warning: Disk usage at "$5}' 

Explanation:

    #!/bin/bash: Indicates that the script should be run using the Bash shell.
    df -h: Executes the df command to display disk space usage in a human-readable format.
        -h: Gives sizes in "human-readable" format (e.g., GB or MB).
    |: The pipe operator takes the output of the df -h command and sends it as input to the following command (awk).
    awk '$5 > 80 {print "Warning: Disk usage at "$5}': This part processes the output from df.
        $5: Refers to the fifth column of the df output, which contains the percentage of disk space used.
        > 80: Checks if the disk usage percentage exceeds 80%.
        {print "Warning: Disk usage at "$5}: If the condition is true, it prints a warning message indicating the current disk usage.




3. System Health Monitoring Script (health_monitoring.sh)
Code Example:

#!/bin/bash
echo "CPU Load: $(uptime)"
echo "Memory Usage: $(free -h)"  

Explanation:

    #!/bin/bash: Specifies that the script should run under the Bash shell.
    echo "CPU Load: $(uptime)":
        uptime: This command gives information about the system load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes.
        $(...): Command substitution, which means that the output of the uptime command will be included in the string.
        The entire line prints the current CPU load as part of the message.
    echo "Memory Usage: $(free -h)":
        free -h: Displays the total, used, and free amount of memory in the system in a human-readable format.
        Again, $(...) captures this output and includes it in the printed message.





4. User Management Script (user_management.sh)
Code Example:

#!/bin/bash
case $1 in
    add)
        sudo adduser $2
        ;;
    delete)
        sudo deluser $2
        ;;
    list)
        cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Usage: $0 {add|delete|list} [username]"
esac

Explanation:

    #!/bin/bash: Indicates the script is to be interpreted by the Bash shell.
    case $1 in: Begins a case statement that examines the first argument passed to the script ($1).
    add): If the first argument is add, the following commands execute:
        sudo adduser $2: Uses sudo to run the adduser command, which creates a new user with the username provided in the second argument ($2).
    delete): If the first argument is delete, the following command executes:
        sudo deluser $2: Uses sudo to run the deluser command, which deletes the user specified by the second argument.
    list): If the first argument is list, the following command executes:
        cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd: This command processes the /etc/passwd file, extracting the first field (-f1), which contains usernames. -d: specifies that : is the delimiter.
    *): This catch-all option runs if none of the preceding conditions are met, executing:
        echo "Usage: $0 {add|delete|list} [username]": Prints the correct usage of the script to the console, guiding the user on how to invoke the script properly.
    esac: Ends the case statement.
